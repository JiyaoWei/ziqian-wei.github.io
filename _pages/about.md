I am a fifth-year direct PhD student at the [Key Laboratory of Network Data Science and Technology](http://www.bigdatalab.ac.cn/) of the [Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ict.ac.cn/). My research interests include natural language processing, large models, and knowledge graphs.

I am lucky to have the guidance of [Professor Jin Xiaolong](http://bigdatalab.ac.cn/jxl/).
